# Spotify Visualizer Project Improvements

This document outlines potential updates and improvements for the Spotify Visualizer project.

## Data Robustness

The current data processing logic assumes a very specific format for the JSON files. To make the application more robust, the following improvements should be considered:

*   **Handle variations in field names:** Spotify's JSON export format can have different field names for the same data (e.g., `ts` vs. `endTime`, `msPlayed` vs. `ms_played`). The data processing logic should be updated to handle these variations.
*   **Filter out invalid data:** The application should filter out entries with invalid or missing data (e.g., `msPlayed` is 0, or `artistName`/`trackName` are null) to prevent calculation errors and ensure accurate statistics.

## Error Handling

The current error handling is quite basic. To improve the user experience, the following enhancements should be made:

*   **Provide specific error messages:** Instead of a generic "Error reading or parsing files" message, the application should provide more specific error messages to the user. For example, it could tell the user which file is causing the issue and why.
*   **Handle no valid data found:** If no valid data is found after processing the user-uploaded files, the application should display a specific error message and hide the summary and chart sections.

## User Experience

The user experience could be improved with the following additions:

*   **Add a loading indicator:** Processing large JSON files can take some time. The application should display a loading indicator to give the user feedback while the files are being processed.
*   **Improve the file selection experience:** The application could be improved by allowing users to drag and drop their files onto the page.
*   **Add more charts and stats:** The application could be enhanced by adding more charts and statistics, such as a chart showing the user's listening activity by time of day or a list of their top genres.
